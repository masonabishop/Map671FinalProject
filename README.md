# Food Access Near Acoma & Laguna Pueblos

Food deserts are defined by the [USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45014/30940_err140.pdf) as "areas where people have limited access to a variety of healthy and affordable food." [This map](Images/FoodAccess_LagunaAcoma_600dpi.png) is a quick glimpse at what a food desert might look like in an underserved area, like my home reservations in New Mexico.
